# Cheat Sheet for Undergraduate Students
This repository consists of cheat sheets of various programming topics essential for undergrad computer science students.

## Structure of files
* Everything is written in Markdown files, and are available in the [src](/src) folder.
* You can also access the pdf version of all the copiled markdowns [here](/Book.pdf).

## How to use 
* You can directly read contents from markdown files or you can clone the repository locally and compile a latest pdf version of all markdown files as a handbook and use it. 
* Cloning simply means, having a copy of this repository locally.
* **(Linux/MacOS)** After cloning, move to that directory. If you are uning Unix compliant systems like Linux or MacOS, you can provide executable permission to the `compile.sh` file by typing `chmod +x compile.sh`. And now `compile.sh` is executable.
* You can create latest pdf version of all markdown files by running `./compile.sh` in your terminal.
* **(Windows)** If you are using windows, you cannot execute the above commands directly in `command prompt`, you should either use *Windows subsystem for Linux* or instal *git bash for windows*. More on that a little later.
